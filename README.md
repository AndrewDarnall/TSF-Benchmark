# Time Series Forecasting Benchmark


This project explores the benchmarking of **univariate time series forecasting**, focusing on comparing the performances of various models. The models analyzed include traditional 
**statistical models** such as **ARIMA** and **SARIMA**, as well as modern **deep learning models** like **LSTM** and **Transformer** networks. 
Additionally, the study delves into a new class of emerging technologies, **continuous deep learning models**, 
with a particular emphasis on **Liquid Time Constant Networks** and their **Closed-form Approximation**.

The benchmark is conducted using a simple univariate time series dataset, serving as a reference for all models. 
Beyond evaluating the **inference performance** of each model, the analysis also considers the **advantages and trade-offs** 
of using one class of models over others for similar forecasting tasks. 
This comprehensive approach provides insights into the conditions under which certain models may outperform others, 
facilitating more informed decision-making in model selection for time series forecasting.
