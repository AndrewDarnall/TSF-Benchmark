# Liquid Time Constant Networks Presentation

I had the pleasure of presenting the slides above as a seminar to the 
**First Person Vision Group** at the 
**Department of Mathematics and Computer Science** of the 
**University of Catania**. 
It was an honor to work with this group under a research scholarship, focusing on topics such as **Liquid Time Constant Networks**, **Closed Form Continuous Time Networks**, and **Neural Circuit Policies**.
